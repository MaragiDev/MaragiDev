[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=php,html,css,ts,js,py,md)](https://maragi.is-cool.dev)

I am a **self-taught developer**, i started getting into computing when i was young, and i started building html apps and extended to exploring diffrent programming languages.<br>
<br>
I sometimes **explore the world of music and create my own**, when im bored i have other passions, one of them includes creating music and nice melodies.<br>
<br>
I **Create my own artwork**, i dont like paying for things, so i create my own artwork and logos.<br>
<br>
Everything i make is **free of charge**, I dont like paying for things online,<br>
i try my hardest to find free alternatives that work and sometimes make my own applications that are free of charge for others to use.<br>
<br>
**My ambition** as a developer is to create a organised group of developers that can work together with me, I love working with others and being socialable.
