<br>
I **Create my own artwork**, i dont like paying for things, so i create my own artwork and logos.<br>
<br>
Everything i make or the services i offer are **free of charge**, I dont like paying for things online.<br>
I try my hardest to find free alternatives that work and sometimes make my own applications that are free of charge for others to use.<br>

**My ambition** as a developer is to soley help others and make a sense of community that people feel they can be themselves in, I love working with others and being socialable.
